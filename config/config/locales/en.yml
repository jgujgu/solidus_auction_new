    hints:
      spree/auction:
        title: Many of the fields will be disabled after the auction starts, so be sure to choose wisely!
        reserve_price: The minimum price for someone to win the auction. Not setting a reserve price may, counterintuitively, make bidding more competitive.
        start: Please make sure to set your time zone in your user profile, so this updates correctly.
        planned_end_datetime: After the auction has started, you cannot change this field.
        countdown: This many seconds before the current end datetime, any new, high bids will increase the length of the auction by "time increment" amount of seconds. For example, with countdown as 300 (5 minutes) and time increment as 60 (1 minute), if the current price is $20.00 and somebody bids $30.00 with 3 minutes left, the end of the auction will be 1 minute more into the future, leaving 4 minutes left. It is okay for the time increment to be longer than the countdown.
        bid_increment: When a bidder bids, they have to bid the current price + this amount in order to succesfully bid. For example, if the current price is $25.00 and bid increment is $2.50, the next successful bidder must bid $27.50 or more.
        time_increment: Number of seconds to increase the end of the auction when within countdown.
        end: This is different from "Planned End" because the "countdown" and "time increment" can change the originally chosen date and time.
        checkout_time_minutes: The amount of time the successful bidder has to make payment on your auction. Default is 1 day (1440 minutes) and maximum is 1 week (10080 minutes). Make it as urgent as you want.
